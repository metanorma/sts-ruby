= Ruby library for NISO STS and ISOSTS

== Purpose

The `sts` Ruby gem allows you to work with NISO STS (0.2+) and ISOSTS documents.

NOTE: This is a work-in-progress.

This library now parses the reference
https://www.iso.org/schema/nisosts/v0.2/doc/tbx/examples/tbx-examples.html[TBX-ISO-TML version 1.1 sample file]
in the NISO STS format (`tbx-nisosts-0.2.xml`).

== Library

=== Usage

The following code parses a NISO STS XML document.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'sts'
doc = IO.read('spec/fixtures/tbx-nisosts-0.2.xml')
sts = Sts::NisoSts::Standard.from_xml(doc)
puts sts.to_xml(pretty: true)
# => STS file round-tripped
